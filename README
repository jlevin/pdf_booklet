pdf_booklet
===========

pdf_booklet is a command-line utility that takes multi-page pdf scans of an unbound book (two pages per page) and returns a pdf with all the pages in the correct order.  In other words, if you took the staples out of a booklet, and the whole thing through a scanner, this script would turn that output file into an ordered multipage pdf.  

Dependencies

1. Install pdftk server.  It is used to split apart and re-order pdfs.

2. Install imagemagick.  This is used to manipulate pdf images.  Install using homebrew.  
   brew install imagemagick

3. Install rmagick.  This works with imagemagick via ruby.  Install using rubygems. 
   gem 'rmagick'

4. Install ghostscript, a pdf interpreter.  Install using homebrew.  
   brew install ghostscript

Usage

Move the target pdfs into the same directory as pdf_booklet.rb.  In the terminal type:

	$ ruby pdf_booklet.rb example1.pdf example2.pdf

OR to target all pdfs in that directory

	$ ruby pdf_booklet.rb *.pdf

pdf_booklet will create a new folder called booklets and output files will be placed there.
